This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze and visualize hotel performance data across multiple dimensions including revenue, booking trends, customer behavior, and capacity utilization.

📌 Objective
To explore revenue performance, average daily rates (ADR), occupancy metrics, discount patterns, and parking capacity across City Hotels and Resort Hotels over a 2.5-year period (2018–2020), helping stakeholders make informed operational and strategic decisions.

📊 Key Dashboard Features
Total Revenue: $14.79M with dynamic slicing by hotel type and country

Average ADR: $104.46

Total Nights Booked: 368K

Average Discount Applied: 25.81%

Required Car Parking Spaces: 8.69K

Time-Series Analysis: Revenue trends over time by hotel type

Yearly Breakdown Table: Revenue, parking space needs, and parking % per year

Donut Chart: Revenue contribution split between City Hotels and Resort Hotels

Filters: Interactive filters for hotel type, country, and reservation date range

🔍 Insights & Observations
Resort Hotels accounted for slightly more than 46% of total revenue, but City Hotels generated a higher volume in certain months, suggesting seasonal and location-based influences.

Revenue peaked during mid-2019, followed by noticeable declines in early 2020, possibly due to travel restrictions or other macro factors.

The average discount rate of 25.81% indicates aggressive promotional efforts that may need evaluation for profitability.

Parking space utilization remains low (2%), which may inform infrastructure planning and upselling strategies.
